This project aims to develop a robust face recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model leverages deep learning techniques to accurately identify and verify individuals based on their facial features. The CNN architecture is designed to extract and learn intricate patterns from facial images, making it highly effective for face recognition tasks. <br>
<br>
Dataset: Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW) by University of Massachusetts. <br>
Link dataset: https://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/

### Key Features:
**1. Data Preprocessing**: The dataset consists of labeled facial images, which are preprocessed to enhance quality and consistency. Techniques such as normalization, resizing, and augmentation are applied to improve model performance. <br>
**2. CNN Architecture**: The model employs a multi-layer CNN to capture spatial hierarchies in the images. Layers include convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, optimized for feature extraction and classification. <br>
**3. Training and Validation**: The model is trained on a diverse dataset of facial images, with a portion reserved for validation to ensure accuracy and generalization. Techniques like dropout and batch normalization are used to prevent overfitting. <br>
**4. Performance Evaluation**: The systemâ€™s performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and Confusion Matrix. These metrics help in fine-tuning the model for optimal results. <br>
**5. Applications**: This face recognition system can be applied in various domains, including security, authentication, and personalized user experiences. <br>
